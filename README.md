  To make your snake game look prettier, you can:

  Use smoother colors and gradients for the background, snake, and food.
  Add rounded corners to the snake and food.
  Animate transitions (e.g., snake movement, food appearance).
  Display a game over screen with a restart button.
  Add sound effects for eating food and game over.
  Use custom fonts and style the score display.
  Add a shadow or glow effect to the snake and food.
  Make the obstacles visually distinct (e.g., with patterns or icons).
  Would you like me to implement a few of these visual improvements directly in your code? If yes, please specify your preferences (e.g., colors, effects, or features).
